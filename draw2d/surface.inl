/* Inline functions need to have a definition that is visible to the compiler
 * whenever the function is used. THey could be define in the header that
 * declares the function. However, to keep the definitions and declarations
 * somewhat apart, it is a common practice to move them to an "inline" file
 * such as this one (*.inl extension). This file is then #include:ed at the end
 * of the header, to ensure that whoever includes the header also automatically
 * includes the inline file.
 *
 * Inlining allows us to avoid any overheads related to call (when building in
 * "release mode" / with optimizations enabled). This makes functions like
 * set_pixel_srgb() zero overhead abstractions.
